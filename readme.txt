Enables automatic fixes for digital accessibility issues across your site with a user-friendly dashboard and installs an accessibility menu for site visitors.

== Description ==

Make-Sense Digital Accessibility for WP is a plugin that helps bring your website into compliance with digital accessibility guidelines by flagging concerns and automatically solving basic issues.

To avoid accessibility lawsuits and ensure that all users can freely access your web content, your site needs to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Make-Sense for WP provides an easy-to-use solution for you to ensure your website meets these guidelines.

Unlike other digital accessibility tools, Make-Sense’s platform employs a hybrid approach to help you achieve compliance quickly while making sure all issues can be addressed permanently in the source code. The application creates a simple menu for end-users to tailor website settings to their particular needs. On the website administration side, Make-Sense’s platform automatically resolves basic compliance issues, and then flags more complex issues that need to be remediated in your site’s source code. 

Features:
●	Hybrid approach to digital accessibility that makes it easy to resolve and prevent accessibility issues
●	Site menu that makes it easy for users to navigate the site and make modifications for accessibility purposes
●	User-friendly dashboard that displays details and data about your site’s accessibility, as well as any outstanding concerns
●	ISO 27001 Information Security Certification

Make-Sense Digital Accessibility for WP lets you reduce the cost and complexity of achieving compliance on your site, so you can focus on business growth and enhance your web content for all of your users.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Follow the setup procedure to register your plugin and receive an active freemium license for your domain.
4. Configure and enable the A-Web menu on your published pages.

The license is always bound to a single domain where it will be active.
At any time, you can switch your license to be active on a different domain. To do so, please deactivate the plugin and follow steps 3 and 4 again.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why am I required to authenticate myself with my social media login?

You are required to log in through your social provider to verify your identity. This will serve as your account in our systems.
These credentials effectively become your single login to our platform, so you can access the dashboard with ease.

By logging in, Make-Sense does not receive access to your third-party settings or profile data. We only require the minimal permissions information, which is your full name and email address.

= How can I switch the domain where my license is registered?

Please deactivate the plugin and activate it again. 
Once deactivated, all local data that is stored by the plugin will be cleared, so on reactivation you will be prompted to follow the setup flow again.
If you use the same authentication credentials as used before, you will have the option of automatically registering the same domain as before or registering a new domain under the same account.

= How can I review my site report?

Click on the Dashboard sub-menu inside the Make-Sense menu. This will redirect you to our system dashboard. 
There you can see all information regarding issues collected by our A-Web runtime.
You can filter the view by timeframe or by violation type.
